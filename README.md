Here are my solutions to wk4. They're due some refactoring - I haven't got CR on wk3 yet.

I have fewer queries this week regarding whether or not my approach was appropriate. However, my persistent questions from wk3 are:

* I'm getting some warnings for unused types, e.g. BFPRogram struct.
Why is this? AFAIK I'm using the file_name type, which is giving a warning.
* How could I have used generic types and ownership/borrowing to greater effect?
* I don't quite understand how Box<dyn<std::error::Error>> works.
Could we please discuss this?
